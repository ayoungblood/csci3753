## Programming Assignment 3

#### Building and Running

This project is set up to build and run on OS X. To build and run with the course-provided test files, simply run `make test`. There are two additional make targets provided: `make test-med` and `make test-big`. These will build a run the resolver on larger input sets (`-med` is 6 files, 100 domains each; `-big` is 6 files, 1000 domains each), as the input set provided by the assignment is not sufficient to accurately benchmark the program.

In order to build and run on Linux, a few small modifications to the makefile are in order:

* Add `-pthread` to `LIBS` (clang warns about an unused argument on OS X)
* Remove all flags except for `-Wall -Wextra` from `CFLAGS` (due to issues in `util.c/.h`, `-std=c11` will throw warnings and errors on Linux)

When the program is finished, the elapsed CPU time (from `clock()`, provided by `time.h`) is displayed, as well as the number of resolver threads and the queue size used.

The program cannot be checked using Valgrind on a Mac because the Valgrind port on OS X has "issues". On Linux, Valgrind shows no leaked memory, although some memory may be left "still reachable", depending on the compiler and libraries used.

#### Limits

MAX_INPUT_FILES: The number of input files is unbounded, but due to architectural limitations stops being unlimited once the number of files exceeds INT_MAX less two.

MAX_RESOLVER_THREADS: The number of resolver threads is set to four times the logical number of cores, as benchmarking has shown this to be performant.

MIN_RESOLVER_THREADS: As stated above, the minimum resolver thread count used is four (on a single core machine).

MAX_NAME_LENGTH: 1024 characters (1025 including null terminator). Domains are restricted to 253 characters (see [Restrictions on valid host names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#Restrictions_on_valid_host_names)), and therefore 1024 ought to be plenty.

MAX_IP_LENGTH: INET6_ADDRSTRLEN. This program only does IPv4, and therefore this is plenty.

#### Benchmark Results

Using `input-med` test file group on rMBP (2.6 GHz i5, four logical cores). Queue size: 32.

Unable to create more than 60 threads

As name resolution is not CPU- or disk-bound, better performance with many more threads than cores makes sense: the resolver threads spend most of their time waiting on network I/O, and therefore do not require the CPU during this interval. As a result, four or eight times as many threads as there are cores allows the OS to schedule threads at a higher efficiency.
